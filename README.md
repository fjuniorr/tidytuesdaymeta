# tidytuesdaymeta

The goal of `tidytuesdaymeta` is to provide a `usethis` style package to simplify the creation of each week's `#tidytuesday`.
Most of the functions are simply for my internal use, but the `create_tidytuesday_folder()`, `next_tuesday()`, and `next_week_num()` functions may be useful for others.

## Installation

You can install the dev version of tidytuesdaymeta from GitHub with:

``` r
remotes::install_github("jthomasmock/tidytuesdaymeta")
```
